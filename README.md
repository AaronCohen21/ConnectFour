# Connect Four

This project is a way for me to get more comfortable using JavaScript. I am currently learning the language, and I hope to over time be able to create a working multiplayer game as I gain the necessary skills.

Currently, to play the game, in the repository folder run `node game.js`

## TODO
- [ ] Create connect four game CLI to run with `node.js`
- [ ] Create working UI with `two.js`
- [ ] Integrate game to work with UI
- [ ] Use GitHub pages to deploy front-end
- [ ] Find some way to use `node.js` to make the game multiplayer
